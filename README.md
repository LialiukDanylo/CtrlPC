# CtrlPC

CtrlPC is a two-part application that allows you to remotely manage the power state of any PC within your local network from your smartphone. You can shut down, restart, or put a PC to sleep directly from the mobile app.

## Features

* ‚ú® Simple local network control of multiple PCs
* ‚è≥ One-tap commands: Sleep, Restart, Shutdown
* üì∂ Automatic discovery of PCs in the network

## How It Works

* **Desktop App (Server):** Runs silently in the background on Windows PCs. It listens for incoming UDP commands and executes them.
* **Mobile App (Client):** Scans the local network, lists available PCs, and allows the user to send commands.
